# Test mmobomb API

Note: This is just a university project, nothing special.

If the API fails to load on the website, try running this command in the terminal:

```flutter run -d chrome --web-browser-flag "--disable-web-security```

For mobile, if the API doesn't load, make sure to cold boot the emulator before running the app
